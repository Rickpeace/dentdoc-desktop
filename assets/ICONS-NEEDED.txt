ICON FILES NEEDED FOR DENTDOC DESKTOP APP
==========================================

You need to create the following icon files and place them in this assets/ directory:

1. icon.png (256x256px or larger)
   - Main application icon
   - Should feature the DentDoc logo/branding
   - Used for notifications and window icon

2. icon.ico (Windows icon file)
   - Convert icon.png to .ico format
   - Should contain multiple sizes (16x16, 32x32, 48x48, 256x256)
   - Used for the installed application icon
   - You can use online tools like: https://icoconvert.com/

3. tray-icon.png (16x16px or 32x32px)
   - Small icon for system tray (normal state)
   - Should be simple and recognizable at small size
   - Orange color scheme to match branding (#f97316)
   - Suggestion: Simple "D" letter or tooth icon

4. tray-icon-recording.png (16x16px or 32x32px)
   - Small icon for system tray (recording state)
   - Same as tray-icon.png but with red dot or indicator
   - Clearly shows recording is active

TEMPORARY SOLUTION:
------------------
For now, you can use placeholder colored squares:
- The app will run but icons won't look professional
- Replace with proper icons before distribution

CREATING ICONS:
--------------
1. Design in Figma, Adobe Illustrator, or Canva
2. Export as PNG with transparent background
3. For .ico file, use online converter or:
   npm install -g png2icons
   png2icons icon.png icon.ico
